Welcome to Automation.SetOEMInformation buildingblock

These module will set OEM information visible in File Explorer - Properties. There are 2 modules: One module to download the oemlogo (192x192 pixels) to a temporary location and another module to set the OEM information and copy the logo to the definitive location.
After scheduling the two modules, when you select File Explorer - Properties, you see the system and support information with the logo.
See also the example screen.
